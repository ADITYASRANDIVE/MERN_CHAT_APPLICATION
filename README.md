Future Scope: The main objective of the project is to develop a Secure Chat Application. I had taken a wide range of literature review in order to achieve all the tasks, where I came to know about some of the products that are existing in the market. I made a detailed research in that path to cover the loop holes that existing systems are facing and to eradicate them in our application. In the process of research I came to know about the latest technologies and different algorithms.
With the knowledge I have gained by developing this application, I am confident that in the future I can make the application more effectively by adding this services.

Extending this application by providing Authorisation service.
Creating Database and maintaining users.
Increasing the effectiveness of the application by providing Voice Chat.
Extending it to Web Support.
